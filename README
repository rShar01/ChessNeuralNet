1.
  given a board position, generate all possible moves and assign each a weighting
2.
  using a value network, generate best move (depth tbd)
3.
  compare the value of move it eventually decides is best against Magnus' move in that same situation
  (I have 2000 of his games ready for this)
4.
  The value difference between Mangus' move and the ai's move is how much the weighting must be adjusted
  (I have a function setup for evaluation loosely based on Stockfish's evaluation policy)

TODO: 
1. fix NoneType bug in feed_forward()
  possible issues: evaluation method is returning none (stockfish?)
                   weights @ piece_type is indexing wrong
