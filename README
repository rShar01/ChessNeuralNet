# Python Chess AI
## What Does it do?
- A chess algorithm designed to play chess mimicking the likes of Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, and Vassily Ivanchuck
- Uses a tensorflow (specifically Keras) model to evaluate any given position
- Utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search to search possible future moves and decide the best move given a position

## Why?
- I wanted to learn more about machine learning and value models
- I like and somewhat understand chess and wanted to generate a self-playing algorithm

## Future steps / TODO:
1. Finish Monte Carlo Search (Q learning?)
2. Add UI
